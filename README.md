### Problem

I have several open source projects, all of which are incrementally developed fully within
 [Git](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-explain-what-Git-is-does-to-someone-who-is-not-a-programmer/answer/Jake-Boxer)
 [repository management services](https://medium.com/flow-ci/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-gitlab-vs-coding-7cf2b43888a1)
 such as GitHub. The number of things I (the **Client**) wish to accomplish is enough for me to seek freelance IT professionals (**Workers**).

The full lifecycle in freelance IT work is composed of multiple parts such as
marketing, recruitment, interviewing, hiring, negotiation, management, development, validation, payment.
Typically these parts don't behave in tandem because they are unnecessarily segregated.

92% of the messages I receive from recruiters are irrelevant, indicating an ineffective low accuracy [r-selection strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory).
In my experience, interviews are not reflective of the actual work and both sides could easily blow 4 hours of time having an aimless chat.
Similarly, management and development suffer from anemic requirements that lead to spending time doing the wrong thing
and frustrating the workers in particular.

Combined, this is an enormous waste of time that everyone has to pay for: the investors, workers and consumers.
What's worse, it's impossible to measure the impact of individual decisions, which leads to further speculation-driven decisions.
All this prevents brilliant ideas from blooming and that is very sad.

### Solution

Git Work solves the problem with the principle of "**Interprocedural Optimization**".
We appropriately fuse the distinct parts that belong together.

For example, the interviews are reduced to doing the *actual* work.
When the **Client** accepts your good work, you get paid and he gets the work.

The **Worker** benefits from working against small and well-defined **Work items**.

No waste; both sides win!
