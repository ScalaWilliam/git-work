### The Problem

I have several open source and personal projects, all of which are iteratively developed fully within
 [Git](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-explain-what-Git-is-does-to-someone-who-is-not-a-programmer/answer/Jake-Boxer)
 [repository management services](https://medium.com/flow-ci/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-gitlab-vs-coding-7cf2b43888a1)
 such as GitHub. The number of things I (**Client**) wish to accomplish is enough for me to seek freelance IT professionals (**Workers**).

The full lifecycle in freelance IT work is composed of multiple parts such as:
recruitment, hiring, negotiation, management, development, payment.
From my professional experience, these parts are disjoint but I won't get into the reasons why.
When highly coupled parts are disjoint, you typically get inefficiency and I am not a fan of inefficiency.

Git Work fuses this lifecycle into a remarkably simple flow: for example, interviews are reduced to
doing the *actual* work... and if you succeed, getting paid for it!
This is contrary to my experience of interviews where you do very little of the actual work
and have just blown 4 hours of your day having a chat.

The core principle of Git Work is "**Interprocedural Optimization**", where parts that should 
belong together do indeed belong together. This principle may have a profound effect on
developing projects to a level of aptness we've not yet seen.
