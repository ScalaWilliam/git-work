### The Problem

I have several open source and personal projects, all of which are iteratively developed fully within
 [Git](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-explain-what-Git-is-does-to-someone-who-is-not-a-programmer/answer/Jake-Boxer)
 [repository management services](https://medium.com/flow-ci/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-gitlab-vs-coding-7cf2b43888a1)
 such as GitHub. The number of things I (the **Client**) wish to accomplish is enough for me to seek freelance IT professionals (**Workers**).

The full lifecycle in freelance IT work is composed of multiple parts such as
recruitment, interviewing, hiring, negotiation, management, development, payment.
Typically these parts don't behave in a tandem because they are disjoint.
Separating parts that should be coupled leads to inefficiency,
and you are most likely not a fan of inefficiency as a technical person.

For instance, 90% of messages I receive from recruiters are irrelevant to me.
The lucky clients, at interview stage mostly spend time testing things that
are not reflective of the actual work. You could easily blow 4 hours on a
chat if you choose to go to an interview.

This is an enormous waste of time that prevents brilliant ideas from blooming.

### The solution

Git Work solves the problem with the principle of "**Interprocedural Optimization**".
We fuse distinct procedures where appropriate.

For example, the interviews are reduced to doing the *actual* work.
When the **Client** accepts your quality of work, you get paid and he gets the work.

No waste; both sides win!
