### Problem

I have several open source and personal projects, all of which are iteratively developed fully within
 [Git](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-explain-what-Git-is-does-to-someone-who-is-not-a-programmer/answer/Jake-Boxer)
 [repository management services](https://medium.com/flow-ci/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-gitlab-vs-coding-7cf2b43888a1)
 such as GitHub. The number of things I (the **Client**) wish to accomplish is enough for me to seek freelance IT professionals (**Workers**).

The full lifecycle in freelance IT work is composed of multiple parts such as
recruitment, interviewing, hiring, negotiation, management, development, payment.
Typically these parts don't behave in a tandem because they are disjoint.
Separating parts that should be coupled leads to inefficiency,
and you are most likely not a fan of inefficiency as a technical person.

For instance, 92% of messages (*I have evidence*) I receive from recruiters are totally irrelevant to me.
The lucky clients, at interview stage mostly spend time testing things that
are not reflective of the actual work. You could easily blow 4 hours on a
chat if you choose to go to an interview.

This is an enormous waste of time that someone has to pay for.
This prevents brilliant ideas from blooming and that is very sad.

### Solution

Git Work solves the problem with the principle of "**Interprocedural Optimization**".
We fuse distinct procedures where appropriate.

For example, the interviews are reduced to doing the *actual* work.
When the **Client** accepts your quality of work, you get paid and he gets the work.

No waste; both sides win!
