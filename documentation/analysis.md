## Related services

See my article: [2017 freelance development platforms](https://dev.to/scalawilliam/2017-freelance-development-platforms).

Git-focused services are more granular, lower priced, and less bureaucratic.

Dispute processes are complex, not fun and difficult. Requires Escrow.

Reviews, interviews and comprehensive testing are necessary because of trust and commitment issues.
Probably necessary because clients don't know how to evaluate work.

Price and commission appear to be important factors.

There is no clear development workflow.
For Git Work to work, there should be a very clear workflow that can be optimised.

Two of the platforms focus on Git as the place of communication.

Too-restrictive platforms will be [used as springboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuqCJpzyK4g).
