We reduce scope by narrowing down what the **Client** and the **Worker** are.

We reduce scope by excluding unnecessary features.

## The Client

Based on the analysis, the **Client** **must be** technically competent to evaluate the **Work**
and know **Git** as well as the Git hosting platforms.

Git Work thus does not target non-technical people as **Clients**.
Non-technical people will be the clients of the **Client**,
but only within a greater system which is out of scope.

The **Client** is a technical manager, architect, or lead developer.
He builds software incrementally, where **Work Items** do not take more than 4 hours.

Any items that take longer than that are too large, and thus are to be broken down.
The **Client** is competent enough how to subdivide work items.

## The Worker

The **Worker** has to be somebody who knows how to use **Git** and is technical to do the work.
He may belong to IT professions such as:
* Software architect
* Software engineer
* Quality assurance
* Business analyst
* Software tester
* Technical writer
* Web designer
* Web developer
* Graphics designer
* DevOps engineer
* Visualisation engineer
* Data scientist

## User Workflow

An explicit workflow is specified in to ensure there is certainty in every aspect of using Git Work.

A clear workflow is essential. Bug-driven development, Gitchiu (to create new Issues from commits quickly).
 
Allow **Workers** to work incrementally in a bug-driven development fashion
and communicates important information to the **Client**.

The communications channel is Git Issues and private communications are not permitted.

## Disputes

Dispute handling is essential when dealing with many **Clients**,
so for the sake of the system at least initially there is only 1 **Client**, the **Git Work Man**.
This puts Dispute resolution out of scope and simplifies the project significantly. No Escrows needed.

So, there are no obligations from either side.

By taking on larger or unclear pieces of work, the **Worker** risks not being paid by the **Client** for the work done,
and the **Client** risks wasting his own time and not getting paid.

There are other platforms for those wanting to play the dispute game.

## Interface

The command interface is via Git Issues.

The listing interface is the Git Work website.

New **Work Items** are be posted to Twitter at minimum, but it is worth exploring other platforms where work can be posted.
Where items are posted on social media, they appear as rich media.

There is a dashboard to view metrics of the system for validation.
