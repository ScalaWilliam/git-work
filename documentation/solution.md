# Solution

Git Work targets a technical manager or architect who builds software incrementally,
where the individual pieces of work would last less than half a working day. Where the piece is too large,
 it must be broken down.
 
There are no obligations from either side, so no contracts aside those of rights and licensing.
By taking on larger or unclear pieces of work, the **Worker** risks not being paid by the **Client** for the work done,
and the **Client** risks wasting his own time and not getting what he wants.

We are not interested in taking on Escrow services. There are other vendors like Upwork for that, but you'll spend 
far more time wrestling with people rather than simply getting on with the work.


We'll put in extra effort to make sure a good full system workflow is set up as Git Work is only a **piece of the puzzle**
and not a full fledged system for managing work. For example, it can be used with Gitchiu which lets you
create new Issues from commits very quickly. This lets developers work incrementally in a bug-driven development fashion
and communicates important information to the manager behind the delivery.

Feedback is very important, and **Workers** should always communicate to their best ability as should the **Clients**.
Communication outside of Issues is strongly discouraged because it leads to poorer quality of work.
 We will have metrics that help determine good working practices. Well documented Issues should be easy to get **Workers**
 for, whereas badly documented ones will have difficulty.

Initially the system will not be immediately open to new **Clients** to ensure the right workflow is built up.
 We're open to very good incremental technical managers/architects who could become beta-testers and potentially
  full fledged partners in this system. Once the essential bits are complete, Git Work should be finished
  and only small improvements necessary. It should be possible to build new systems on top of Git Work but we 
  cannot see a clear path for it yet. Definitely we see potential for customising user validation 
  and payment methods for example, as currently only PayPal would be supported for simplicity.

The system is open to **Workers**.
