# Solution

Based on the analysis, most importantly the **Client** must be technical in order 
for us to get rid of the interview process. The **Client** must be able to evaluate
 the quality of work by himself.
 
Therefore Git Watch targets a technical manager, architect, or lead developer.
This person builds software incrementally, where the individual pieces of work 
would last less than half a working day.
Where the piece is too large, it must be broken down. He knows how to split work.

Dispute (wrestling) processes are complex and also unnecessary cruft.
So, there are no obligations from either side.
By taking on larger or unclear pieces of work, the **Worker** risks not being paid by the **Client** for the work done,
and the **Client** risks wasting his own time and not getting paid.

Because Disputes are gone, we don't need Escrows.
If someone wants to play the dispute game, they are free to use another system.

A clear workflow is essential. Bug-driven development, Gitchiu (to create new Issues from commits quickly).
 
Allow Workers to work incrementally in a bug-driven development fashion
and communicates important information to the Client.

Communication channel must be next to the repository as well so that we can track 
what is going on. No private communications because that reduces Issue quailty.
 We will have metrics that help determine good working practices.
 Well documented Issues should be easy to get **Workers**
 for, whereas badly documented ones will have difficulty.
