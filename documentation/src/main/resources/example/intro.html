    <h2>Solve a Git issue, get paid.</h2>

        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>I have several open source projects, all of which are incrementally developed fully within <a
                href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-explain-what-Git-is-does-to-someone-who-is-not-a-programmer/answer/Jake-Boxer">Git</a>
            <a href="https://medium.com/flow-ci/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-gitlab-vs-coding-7cf2b43888a1">repository
                management
                services</a> such as GitHub. The number of things I (the <strong>Client</strong>) wish to accomplish is
            enough
            for me to seek freelance IT professionals (<strong>Workers</strong>).</p>
        <p>The full lifecycle in freelance IT
            work is composed of multiple parts such as marketing, recruitment, interviewing, hiring, negotiation,
            management,
            development, validation, payment. Typically these parts don't behave in tandem because they are
            unnecessarily
            segregated.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-simple-trick-7x-less-recruiter-spam-william-vykintas-narmontas">92%
            of the messages I receive from recruiters are irrelevant</a>, indicating an ineffective low accuracy <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory">r-selection strategy</a>. In my experience,
            interviews are not reflective of the actual work and both sides could easily blow 4 hours of time having an
            aimless
            chat. Similarly, management and development suffer from anemic requirements that lead to spending time doing
            the
            wrong thingand frustrating the workers in particular.</p>
        <p>Combined, this is an enormous waste of time that
            everyone has to pay for: the investors, workers and consumers. What's worse, it's impossible to measure the
            impact
            of individual decisions, which leads to further speculation-driven decisions. All this prevents brilliant
            ideas from
            blooming and that is very sad.</p>

    <section id="solution">
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>Git Work solves the problem with the principle of "<strong>Interprocedural Optimization</strong>". We
            appropriately
            fuse the distinct parts that belong together.</p>
        <p>For example, the interviews are reduced to doing the <em>actual</em>
            work. When the <strong>Client</strong> accepts your good work, you get paid and he gets the work.</p>
        <p>The
            <strong>Worker</strong> benefits from working against small and well-defined <strong>Work items</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>No
            waste; both sides win!</p>
